mediasoup demos
===============

This repo contains some example applications that use the [mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/) WebRTC SFU. The examples here aim to be very simple to read and understand, and to that end they contain the **minimum** code required to achieve their purpose. All other accessory concerns or features, such as security or multi-user session handling, are ignored on purpose.

**These demos are not officially supported**. They are written "on the go" as the need for them arises. As such, expect some rough edges or broken code. Having said that, in reality these demos are usually working just fine.

Read each demo's README to find out about what is done and how to make it run:

* [mediasoup-kurento-filter](mediasoup-kurento-filter/README.md)
* [mediasoup-recording](mediasoup-recording/README.md)
